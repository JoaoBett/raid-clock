## üìú Description

This project began as a simple timer to check how much time I was spending between play-time and waiting-time. After some changes it evolved into a complete analysis that stores the progress of each user locally and gives them usefull statistics.
It was a fun project to help me improve in my web application logic that I made from scratch.

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

This project will shift now to a more focused side on Cloud and Cybersecurity. With some new features:

* **Secure Deployment:** Configure a customized domain with HTTPS, API keys management with Environment Variables and using Security Headers such as Content-Security-Policy (CSP).
* **Logging and Monitorization:** Create Cloud Functions to generate a log and send them to an alert activity about the app.
